## installation
Since `conda install` may cause some error (probably because of version conflict) you need to download the needed wheels in advance. (from this link to find suitable wheels based on Pytorch and cuda version:[links](https://data.pyg.org/whl/) 

This repo has wheels suitable for pytorch 1.12 and cuda 11.3
